# Origen Standard Library (OrigenStdLib)

OrigenTesters provides low-level, or bare-metal, APIs which allow an application to generate the components of
an ATE test program.
The application is expected to bring the knowledge of how these low-level APIs should be used to actually create
a test on the target ATE platform.
Similarly, the application is also expected to bring all of the custom code, e.g. C++ or Visual Basic, that it might
need to implement the tests.

The goal of this plugin is provides a standard test library which sits between OrigenTesters and an application, with
the goal of helping application's to reduce the footprint of their custom C++/VB code, and to provide complete
tests off the shelf.
